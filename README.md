# MakeABurger

In this C++ program, the user makes a burger. I used classes, a header file and functions to create this program. I just learnt a bit of OOP and decided to apply it in this program. The way the program works is first the user enters the type of bun he wants, then he picks the meat he wants, then the vegetables and finally the condiments. The program will then output the burger that the user made.
